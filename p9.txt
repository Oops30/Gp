1. Create new project by selecting Universal 3D
2. Go to Game Object and select Plane
adjust the side as u need
3. Again go to Game object and add 2 capsules on the plane
place the capsules linearly 
name 1 capsule as Enemy and 2nd capsule as Player
4. Go to game object and add 2 spheres by attaching it to capsules so that it depicts the face of our character
5. Select Enemy and add script in it
#code
using System.Collections;
using System.Collections.Generic;
using System.Collections.Specialized;
using System.Threading;
using UnityEngine;

public class EnemyTransform : MonoBehaviour
{
    public Transform player;
    public float playerDistance;
    public float rotationDamping;
    public float moveSpeed;

    // Start is called before the first frame update
    void Start()
    {

    }

    // Update is called once per frame
    void Update()
    {
        playerDistance = Vector3.Distance(player.position, transform.position);

        if (playerDistance < 15f)
        {
            LookAtPlayer();
        }
        if (playerDistance > 12f)
        {
            Chase();
        }
    }

    void LookAtPlayer()
    {
        Quaternion rotation = Quaternion.LookRotation(player.position - transform.position);
        transform.rotation = Quaternion.Slerp(transform.rotation, rotation, Time.deltaTime * rotationDamping);
    }
    void Chase()
    {
        transform.Translate(Vector3.forward * moveSpeed * Time.deltaTime);
    }
}
6. In  Enemy capsule Inspector select transform as Player
7. Set rotation damping 10 and move speed 5
8. Run the code
